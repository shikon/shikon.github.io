&lt;p&gt;As I strolled through the heart of Madeira’s city center, the melodic strains of the island’s light orchestra wafted through the air.
It was two weeks till christmas, a bit chillier than usual for Madeira.
The Christmas market was packed with people.
Many of those listening to the orchestra which played harmonious tunes.
Somehow I found it lacked the elusive “wow” factor.
This triggering a memory of a  discussion with one of my closest friends. 
A while back I had a conversation with my friend, a seasoned table tennis player of over a decade. 
In their world, there is a fascinating correlation: the South of the Netherlands is better than the North.
My friend had a simple reason for it, simply due to the sheer number of players in the South.
The more competitors, the higher the level of competition, and consequently, the elevation of skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;connecting-dots-music-and-sports-parallels&quot;&gt;Connecting Dots: Music and Sports Parallels&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help but draw parallels to the world of music and sports. 
In many Dutch cities, it has various smaller clubs and typically one larger club. 
Some of those large club even ascend to play on the grand stage, competing in prestigious tournaments like the UEFA Cup.
But let’s not digress.
Returning to the island’s light orchestra, I contemplated whether the size of the island influenced the perceived quality of their music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;global-challenges-local-perspectives&quot;&gt;Global Challenges, Local Perspectives&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madeira, with a modest population of just over 100k, presents a unique challenge. 
Drawing a statistical parallel to my friend’s insight on table tennis, the chance of a group of individuals achieving world-class musical prowess on a smaller island seems inherently slimmer than in more populous countries like The USA. 
Yet, I hesitate to label this as a problem. 
Rather, I consider it as a matter of perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;local-excellence-a-proud-feat&quot;&gt;Local Excellence: A Proud Feat&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on a local scale can yield its own set of remarkable achievements. 
While dreaming of international recognition is enticing, being the best on the island is no small feat. 
The limited pool of talent fosters a sense of community, where the pursuit of excellence resonates within the confines of the island’s embrace. 
In the end, it’s not just about the size of the stage but the depth of passion that emanates from those who call Madeira home. 
The music I heard that day in Madeira had its own unique cadence that, when appreciated within its context, carries its own harmonious melody.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Lan Hu</name></author><category term="travel" /><category term="music" /><category term="life" /><category term="culture" /><summary type="html">Discovering Harmonies: A Stroll Through Madeira’s Musical Christmas As I strolled through the heart of Madeira’s city center, the melodic strains of the island’s light orchestra wafted through the air.

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I tossed my graduation cap into the air, I’ve made a habit of escaping the chilly winters of The Netherlands. 
The Canary Islands swiftly became my haven, it is a readily accessible retreat offering affordable, visa-free flights. 
On my latest expedition, I embarked on a culinary adventure in Tenerife, where I sought to explore the unexpected interplay of tastes, cultures, and culinary traditions. 
Join me as I delve into the vibrant streets of Tenerife and the enchanting landscapes of Madeira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;no-cow-no-beef&quot;&gt;No cow, no beef&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon landing, my mate and I were on a mission: find the perfect steak tartare restaurant. 
Rumor had it that somewhere on Tenerife a great steak tartare is served. 
After some searching, we discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.app.goo.gl/X6H1d7h7JT25ngkp6&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;. 
Obviously, the entre was already set in stone, the steak tartare. 
Now we were faced with the delightful dilemma of choosing our mains. 
Opting for a succulent rib eye, I eagerly cut into the medium-rare beef and was met with a strangely familiar taste, one that transported me back to Western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;canarian-beef-or-argentinean-beef&quot;&gt;Canarian beef or Argentinean beef&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity piqued and I decided to inquire about the origin of the beef. 
The restaurant staff, friendly and accommodating, confirmed my suspicions with a casual, “Anywhere between the UK and Poland. Depends on the season, really.” 
This unexpected revelation triggered reflections on a recent post I penned about the intricate &lt;a href=&quot;https://shiko.nl/travel/why_travel/&quot;&gt;interplay of culture and food&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike my previous experience with Canarian beef in Gran Canaria, this time the meat had a familiar taste. 
The local cows, it seemed, had given way to imports. 
This observation actually became a recurring theme throughout my holiday; each bite of beef was a reminder of the interconnectedness of global food trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help but marvel at the economic intricacies that made this possible, particularly the timely delivery of perishable goods like Argentine beef via ships. It’s a phenomenon made feasible by the affordability of oil, a topic I delved into in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shiko.nl/growth/pricing_of_oil/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered why soft drinks, such as Coca-Cola or Fanta, seem to carry a hefty price tag? As I pondered this question, I decided to delve deeper into the world of consumer pricing. 
What I found was truly surprising and thought-provoking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;petrol-vs-soft-drinks&quot;&gt;Petrol vs soft drinks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Netherlands, we are fortunate to have access to affordable and clean tap water (which arguably is even cleaner than bottled water) is about &lt;a href=&quot;https://gemiddelden.nl/prijzen/gemiddelde-prijs-per-liter-water/&quot;&gt;1 cent per 7 liters&lt;/a&gt;!
To put this in perspective, let’s compare it to another vital fluid: oil. 
The startling revelation was that a bottle of Coca-Cola, priced at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi130874/coca-cola-regular&quot;&gt;€1.99&lt;/a&gt;, is more expensive than petrol RON 95 (E10), which costs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anwb.nl/vakantie/reisvoorbereiding/brandstofprijzen-europa&quot;&gt;€1.97&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
Yes, you read that correctly; oil is cheaper than branded soft drinks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-luxury-factor&quot;&gt;The luxury factor&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this pricing paradox can be attributed to human desires for luxury and the willingness to pay more for things we like or believe we need. 
I am not one to advocate for consuming less, as I, too, enjoy the occasional soft drink or beer. However, it is truly remarkable to contemplate how something extracted from 2-6 km beneath the Earth’s crust can be priced similarly to flavored water.
Moreover, the comparison extends beyond soft drinks.
Here in the Netherlands a bottle of water costs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi198956/spa-reine-fles&quot;&gt;€1.05&lt;/a&gt;), this is more expensive than petrol in the US (&lt;a href=&quot;https://nl.globalpetrolprices.com/USA/gasoline_prices/&quot;&gt;€1,00&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a realization is baffling.
No, I am not comparing the oil rich middle east countries that have challenges getting fresh purified water.
No, I both are two rich western countries.
Remarkable.
How pricing of consumer goods can be.
Instead, you could also say how cheap oil is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;environmental-consideration&quot;&gt;Environmental consideration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is time to consider the environmental impact of our choices. 
While oil might seem cheap in terms of monetary value, we must also account for its environmental cost. 
This includes factors like carbon emissions, environmental degradation, and the depletion of natural resources. 
Should there be an environmental tax on oil to address these issues? 
Such a discussion is complex, but it demands our attention as we contemplate the future of our planet and the cost of our lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-pricing-paradox&quot;&gt;A pricing paradox&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on the weird pricing of consumer goods in comparison with oil, it becomes apparent that there’s more to pricing than meets the eye. 
The luxury factor and environmental considerations play crucial roles in shaping the costs we see on the price tags. We must be mindful of the choices we make and the impact they have on our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time you reach for that soft drink or fill up your car with petrol, take a moment to contemplate the story behind the price. 
Only then can we begin to shape a future where luxuries are sustainable and our choices reflect a deeper understanding of their true costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m not an avid reader in my day-to-day life, I find solace in reading during my holidays. It’s a time when I can unwind and indulge in the joy of relaxation or knowledge acquisition, unburdened by my usual array of activities such as working on my PC, riding my motorcycle, experimenting in the kitchen, or engaging in my engineering pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;exploring-the-significance-of-time-and-money-through-rich-dad-poor-dad-by-robert-kiyosaki&quot;&gt;Exploring the Significance of Time and Money through “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” by Robert Kiyosaki&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my recent holiday reading, I came across an intriguing concept that I’d like to focus on in this blog post. One key aspect that resonated with me is the power of exponential growth, and I wholeheartedly agree with its importance. When someone is young, time becomes one of the most valuable cards they hold. Without even taking significant actions, a young person with ample time ahead can rapidly grow their wealth simply by starting early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-explosive-power-of-exponential-growth&quot;&gt;The Explosive Power of Exponential Growth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate the significance of time when it comes to your savings account. Assuming a conservative annual growth rate of 7% (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tradethatswing.com/average-historical-stock-market-returns-for-sp-500-5-year-up-to-150-year-averages/&quot;&gt;average&lt;/a&gt; return of the S&amp;amp;P 500 over the last 30 years, adjusted for inflation) and a monthly savings contribution of $100, the impact is astounding.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/shikon/cloudimg/blob/master/typora/compound.jpg?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;compound&quot; /&gt;
If you were to retire at the age of 65, the difference between starting early at age 25 and starting 10 years later is more than double. Even after accounting for the disparity in the total amount saved, with the later start resulting in less money invested, the mathematical comparison is roughly $25,000 / $12,200 &amp;gt; 2!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;embracing-nuances-the-value-of-experiences-and-life-lessons&quot;&gt;Embracing Nuances: The Value of Experiences and Life Lessons&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the theory of exponential growth is well-known among financially savvy individuals, as the book describes it, people with a high financial IQ, I’ve come to realize that maximizing happiness, at least for me, does not entail penny-pinching and saving every dollar when I’m young. In my perspective, the money required to live an enjoyable and fulfilling life is highest during youth. These experiences hold significant value to me and, I believe, should hold a similar value for you as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;seizing-opportunities-in-youth&quot;&gt;Seizing Opportunities in Youth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to provide a few examples to illustrate this point. When you travel to a foreign country, isn’t it more valuable to do so while you’re young? While this may decrease your savings, the experiences and memories gained are immeasurable. Additionally, youth allows for engaging in physically demanding activities such as hiking, canoeing, and mountain biking, taking full advantage of your physical fitness. This is the natural way of things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-power-of-childhood-lessons&quot;&gt;The Power of Childhood Lessons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this concept more relatable to those with children, consider the time you spend with your family when your kids are young. These shared moments compound over time, becoming invaluable life lessons. Anything children learn in their early years lays the foundation for their future growth and development, whether they consciously acknowledge it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;midlife-a-period-of-peaking-costs&quot;&gt;Midlife: A Period of Peaking Costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve created a hand-drawn graph to illustrate a typical life trajectory.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/shikon/cloudimg/blob/master/typora/costs.png?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;valuevstime&quot; /&gt;
 As depicted, your costs peak around the age of 40, assuming a conventional lifestyle. During this phase, your children are likely in their teenage years, which can be financially demanding yet rewarding. Alongside providing for your children, you may desire family vacations and perhaps a larger home to accommodate your growing family. However, as your children grow older and become self-sufficient adults, the financial dependence gradually diminishes. By the time you reach retirement age (65), your expenses&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have decreased significantly compared to your physical prime at ages 20-24.

&lt;p&gt;Considering the information presented above, it becomes evident that the value of each dollar changes throughout life. Instead of solely focusing on costs, you can also perceive it as the value per dollar changing based on your age. I want to emphasize that value is subjective, representing the true worth you assign to something rather than a utilitarian, objective measurement in monetary units ($). This perspective resonates with me at present. There is no magical formula for growing money because when saving money matters most, the value of each dollar is significant, whereas when you have the ability to spend most of your money, the value of each dollar diminishes. In simpler terms, this can be expressed as a higher burn rate when young and a lower burn rate when older. I don’t believe this remains constant throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a time when I can unwind and indulge in the joy of relaxation or knowledge acquisition, unburdened by my usual array of activities such as working on my PC, riding my motorcycle, experimenting in the kitchen, or engaging in my engineering pursuits. Exploring the Significance of Time and Money through “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” by Robert Kiyosaki During my recent holiday reading, I came across an intriguing concept that I’d like to focus on in this blog post. One key aspect that resonated with me is the power of exponential growth, and I wholeheartedly agree with its importance. When someone is young, time becomes one of the most valuable cards they hold. Without even taking significant actions, a young person with ample time ahead can rapidly grow their wealth simply by starting early. The Explosive Power of Exponential Growth Let me illustrate the significance of time when it comes to your savings account. Assuming a conservative annual growth rate of 7% (the average return of the S&amp;amp;P 500 over the last 30 years, adjusted for inflation) and a monthly savings contribution of $100, the impact is astounding. If you were to retire at the age of 65, the difference between starting early at age 25 and starting 10 years later is more than double. Even after accounting for the disparity in the total amount saved, with the later start resulting in less money invested, the mathematical comparison is roughly $25,000 / $12,200 &amp;gt; 2! Embracing Nuances: The Value of Experiences and Life Lessons While the theory of exponential growth is well-known among financially savvy individuals, as the book describes it, people with a high financial IQ, I’ve come to realize that maximizing happiness, at least for me, does not entail penny-pinching and saving every dollar when I’m young. In my perspective, the money required to live an enjoyable and fulfilling life is highest during youth. These experiences hold significant value to me and, I believe, should hold a similar value for you as well. Seizing Opportunities in Youth Allow me to provide a few examples to illustrate this point. When you travel to a foreign country, isn’t it more valuable to do so while you’re young? While this may decrease your savings, the experiences and memories gained are immeasurable. Additionally, youth allows for engaging in physically demanding activities such as hiking, canoeing, and mountain biking, taking full advantage of your physical fitness. This is the natural way of things! The Power of Childhood Lessons To make this concept more relatable to those with children, consider the time you spend with your family when your kids are young. These shared moments compound over time, becoming invaluable life lessons. Anything children learn in their early years lays the foundation for their future growth and development, whether they consciously acknowledge it or not. Midlife: A Period of Peaking Costs I’ve created a hand-drawn graph to illustrate a typical life trajectory. As depicted, your costs peak around the age of 40, assuming a conventional lifestyle. During this phase, your children are likely in their teenage years, which can be financially demanding yet rewarding. Alongside providing for your children, you may desire family vacations and perhaps a larger home to accommodate your growing family. However, as your children grow older and become self-sufficient adults, the financial dependence gradually diminishes. By the time you reach retirement age (65), your expenses1 have decreased significantly compared to your physical prime at ages 20-24. While you may not be as physically capable, many individuals choose to embark on new adventures at a more relaxed pace, given the availability of free time and financial resources. The Changing Value of Each Dollar as You Age Considering the information presented above, it becomes evident that the value of each dollar changes throughout life. Instead of solely focusing on costs, you can also perceive it as the value per dollar changing based on your age. I want to emphasize that value is subjective, representing the true worth you assign to something rather than a utilitarian, objective measurement in monetary units ($).

In simpler terms, this can be expressed as a higher burn rate when young and a lower burn rate when older. I don’t believe this remains constant throughout life.

&lt;p&gt;Traveling is a true passion of mine, just like cooking. It opens up a world of new experiences and allows me to delve into different cultures, especially through their food. While traveling, I often encounter tastes and culinary practices that differ from what I’m accustomed to. It’s natural for humans to gravitate towards what they are familiar with, which means it’s not unusual to have preferences or dislikes when it comes to food from other cultures. Exploring these culinary differences is what truly captivates me, and I find it fascinating to understand the reasons behind the popularity and preferences of various regional dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-influence-of-history-on-food&quot;&gt;The Influence of History on Food&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my travels, I have made some simple yet intriguing observations that highlight the influence of history on the types of food enjoyed in different regions. Here are a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;coastal-cities-and-fresh-fish&quot;&gt;Coastal Cities and Fresh Fish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, coastal cities have had a strong affinity for fish. In the past, fish could only be enjoyed when it was freshly caught, which was feasible only in locations near the sea or other bodies of water. Nowadays, with efficient trade routes and advanced preservation techniques like ice, any type of fish can be transported across the globe. However, the preference for fish remains rooted in the historical context of coastal cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-culinary-impact-of-poverty&quot;&gt;The Culinary Impact of Poverty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poverty often shapes culinary traditions as well. For instance, in Madrid, which was relatively poor in the past, it was challenging to afford premium cuts of meat. This led to the consumption of offal parts such as beef tripe, giving rise to dishes like “Callos” in Spanish cuisine. Similarly, South Korea, having experienced rapid modernization within the last century, still values offal parts due to their historical significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;religious-influence-on-food-choices&quot;&gt;Religious Influence on Food Choices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religious rules and practices have also played a significant role in shaping food preferences. During a recent visit to Romania, a friend and I noticed that beef was relatively expensive compared to pork. After inquiring, we discovered that Romania’s historical association with the Ottoman Empire led to high taxes on beef due to Islamic dietary restrictions. Consequently, beef imports became more common, resulting in fewer local cattle farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-sober-food-culture-of-the-netherlands&quot;&gt;The Sober Food Culture of the Netherlands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Netherlands, there is a unique perspective on food known as “nuchter.” This concept can be described as having an objective and emotionless view, prioritizing efficiency over taste. The Dutch food culture, often characterized by the “AGV” or “PVM” dinner (Potatoes, Veggies, and Meat), is a result of historical circumstances, including times of scarcity such as the Dutch Famine during World War II. Quantity has often taken precedence over quality in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-influence-of-culture&quot;&gt;The Influence of Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture, in its essence, is a culmination of historical events and factors that shape specific traits, including food preferences&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The type of food enjoyed in a particular country is just one aspect of its broader cultural identity. Each country is unique due to a combination of factors such as geography, historical events, and societal customs. The examples I shared merely scratch the surface of the intricate connections between history, culture, and food. I encourage you, as the reader, to embark on your own travel adventures and explore these fascinating relationships firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, my love for traveling stems from the desire to explore diverse cultures, with food being a significant element of that exploration. Through my experiences, I have come to appreciate the influence of history, poverty, religion,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to PCB design, choosing the right software tool is crucial for efficiency and productivity. In this blog post, I will share my experience with two popular tools: EAGLE from Autodesk and Altium Designer. Having initially used EAGLE for my master’s thesis, I later had the opportunity to work with Altium Designer, and I can confidently say that Altium is a superior tool overall. However, EAGLE does have its advantages, such as its affordability, ease of learning, and user-friendly interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-msc-graduation-thesis&quot;&gt;My MSc. Graduation Thesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my thesis, I embarked on the design of a PCB to integrate custom readout electronics. The main objective was to convert a current signal into a voltage signal using a transimpedance amplifier. Additionally, I included a voltage source to ensure signal stability, as well as precise voltage control for the target device. The complexity of the design required several chips to be soldered onto the board. While time constraints and the intricate nature of the project led me to outsource the assembly, I did explore an  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openscopeproject/InteractiveHtmlBom&quot;&gt;open-source tool&lt;/a&gt;.  as a contingency plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assembly-by-professionals&quot;&gt;Assembly by Professionals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I ultimately didn’t have to assemble the PCB myself, I still prepared the Interactive BOM tool and made it available online. I informed the professional assemblers about its existence, and they gladly utilized it. Their positive feedback and ease of use with the tool reinforced its effectiveness. Feedback from field experts is invaluable, and their satisfaction with the tool validated my decision to incorporate it. However, it’s worth noting that the tool is not compatible with Altium, but this limitation didn’t hinder my most recent projects as they were relatively less complex than my graduation project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is what you might think. But let’s spice it up a bit by making them user aware. Okay, let’s put a motion sensor nearby and this activated the lights when you are in the vicinity. Well… no it can be even cooler, how about making it stair-step-aware?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stair-step-awareness&quot;&gt;stair-step-awareness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be cool if the stairs would light up exactly on your current step? I think it would be and that is exactly the goal of today. Towards this, I designed a custom system that adds some flair to your stairs! It consists of three main components,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Addressable RGB led-strip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step presence detection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;addressable-rgb-led-strip&quot;&gt;Addressable RGB led-strip&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To look cool I didn’t opt for just a white led-strip but an RGB one that is individually addressable, because we want to do cool things with it… Such as stair-step awareness (SSA). Our stairs have 12 steps each of approximate length of 1 meter. This means I need 12 meters of LED strip, luckily due to mass fabrication these can be and are quite cheap, but what should one choose? It depends on a few factors but I mainly concentrated on,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;voltage-drop-on-an-rgb-led-strip-and-my-choice&quot;&gt;Voltage drop on an RGB led-strip and my choice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main factor to consider here is that at 12 meters in length the voltage drop can be quite significant, hence choosing LED chips that work with a higher operation voltage are more convenient to use. Why is this? Consider for similar LED efficiency (the same amount of energy is required to give a certain amount of light), the power is constant then for LED with higher operation voltage less current is required. Then by Ohm’s law \(V_{drop} = I^2R\) is lower for LEDs with higher operating voltage. This means the LED strip will not become dim over its length. Additionally, one could opt to connect the power source at regular intervals on the total LED strip, however this requires additional wire and floor planning. Therefore, it is better to choose a more suitable LED strip. The most common options are, 5 V and 12 V. Since 5 V is the lowest option here, 12 V is preferred because of the lower voltage drop. This made my choice to fall on the WS2811 the higher voltage brother of the WS2812B which is common in &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackaday.io/projects?tag=ws2812&quot;&gt;many projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brightness-trueness-of-color-and-power-consumption-etc&quot;&gt;Brightness, trueness of color and power consumption, etc.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waveformlighting.com/led-strip-lights&quot;&gt;many more factors&lt;/a&gt; to consider. Some LED strips are better in some of the factors but in the end the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2000165819.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.3fe63e9dY7W9gl&amp;amp;algo_pvid=7d31ef6a-f8cb-4983-8fcb-fd3d554a5a0c&amp;amp;algo_exp_id=7d31ef6a-f8cb-4983-8fcb-fd3d554a5a0c-0&amp;amp;pdp_ext_f=%7B%22sku_id%22%3A%2210000000953811077%22%7D&amp;amp;pdp_npi=2%40dis%21EUR%21%2114.66%21%21%21%21%21%402100bdf116538193387373611e2f44%2110000000953811077%21sea&quot;&gt;WS2811&lt;/a&gt; was the cheapest per meter and suited my needs. Some alternatives are, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32476317187.html&quot;&gt;SK6812&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32322326979.html&quot;&gt;APA102&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-presence-detection&quot;&gt;Step presence detection&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve the SSA, we need to somehow know when someone is on a step. Let’s consider some mechanics and imagine you are standing on a stair-step. When you step on a step, your foot is on the step. This induces pressure but also your foot is physically there. I came up with the two following mechanisms to detect the presence on a certain step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Light-blocking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;light-blocking&quot;&gt;Light-blocking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your foot is on the step it is physically there. This means if there is a light sensor it would be blocked off by your foot. This could be sideways or in the step itself as depicted here. &lt;img src=&quot;C:\Users\draakje\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220522161715073.png&quot; alt=&quot;image-20220522161715073&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These methods have a few cons, for &lt;em&gt;sideways&lt;/em&gt; you would require an additional light source. For &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; you can use your natural lighting such as diffuse light, however, this would not work very well at night. Also, the intensity can vary over the day so you would need some automatic calibration to distinguish between low light or ‘is being stepped on’ conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pressure&quot;&gt;Pressure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the light-blocking method is possible. I deemed it too complex to do, so I thought of an alternative. Where I use pressure sensors and with this in my I went ahead and found two types of pressure sensors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strain-gauge&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thin-film pressure sensor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strain gauge required me to glue them on the backside of the stairs. In that way, it can bend together with the wood and hence measure presence. This required a lot of glue and modifications so I did not prefer this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas thin films can be placed very unobtrusively onto the stair-step. Since we were planning to use stair nosings profiles, they could be perfectly hidden underneath them. These sensors have huge resistance and once it compresses the resistance decreases. So the controller needs to read the resistance in some smart way to detect presence. More on that below…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;controller&quot;&gt;Controller&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project I needed two main functionalities to be achieved by this controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The controller knows which step I am standing on, SSA
2) Correct color is sent to the RGB led-strip&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most known microcontrollers is the Arduino since it is so popular a lot of libraries are created for it and this makes my life a lot easier. Less time spent on re-inventing the wheel is more time to do cool projects. But, not only software is needed but also hardware since we are using real physical sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thin-film-pressure-sensor-readout&quot;&gt;Thin-film pressure sensor readout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circuitry that is used is very simple, there are two states. Either you are on the step or you are not on the step. These two states can be distinguished by looking at the resistance of the sensor, this means we need to distinguish between high and low resistance states. As mentioned before the resistance decreases if it is compressed hence it makes sense to choose everything below a certain threshold, that is the &lt;em&gt;on the step&lt;/em&gt; state and everything above is &lt;em&gt;not on the step&lt;/em&gt; state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comparator-to-sense-the-state&quot;&gt;Comparator to sense the state&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve state readout we can use a comparator, which can be explained with the following &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparator&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Opamp105.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Comparator - Wikipedia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It basically does what I explained before, if you use a 5 V supply it makes sense to set \(V_{REF} = 2.5V\) and thus choose the resistors equally. However, since I have 12 steps I have to do this 12x?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-multiplexing-is-less-hardware&quot;&gt;Time multiplexing is less hardware&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since OPAMPs are not very cheap ~ €1,- a piece and the number of control pins on the Arduino is limited I chose to do time multiplexing. In time-multiplexing I make use of the fact that I don’t need to constantly know whether someone is &lt;em&gt;on the step&lt;/em&gt;, but only once in a while. The Arduino’s clock frequency is 32 MHz so I could read out my stairs at MHz speeds which means million times per second. But I don’t need to know it that often hence I could easily divide this by 12 and read all 12 steps with time multiplexing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;electronics-schema-for-led-controller-pcb&quot;&gt;Electronics schema for LED controller PCB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve all of the hardware functionalities I created a small PCB that neatly packs everything together, with its schema below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shikon/cloudimg/master/typora/image-20220529124522662.png&quot; alt=&quot;image-20220529124522662&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things to note from left to right and up to down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I used a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000016331112.html&quot;&gt;DC-DC converter&lt;/a&gt; so I could use a single supply for LED and my controller PCB.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some external connector to connect to the LED strip and also control a relay if needed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time multiplexing where W0-W11 are the pressure sensors and IC1 is the multiplexing chip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Biasing for the comparator circuit achieved with OPAMP
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;R4 series resistor to prevent short circuits of the weight sensor&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;R1 is a pulldown resistor&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Arduino, pro mini because it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003822653479.htm&quot;&gt;cheap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
**NOTE**
The labels with same name means they are connected together
---
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arduino-code-for-controller&quot;&gt;Arduino code for controller&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make everything work together of course code is needed. So the software has these functionalities, when the presence is detected it turns all the lights on to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CRGB on(122,122,122)&lt;/code&gt;. The step above your current step will be set to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CRGB stepColordown(255,0,0)&lt;/code&gt; and the step below your current step will be &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CRGB stepColorup(0,255,0)&lt;/code&gt;. After it turns on and the presence is gone, it will fade to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CRGB bgColor( 122, 122, 122)&lt;/code&gt; and after 15 seconds it will fade to no light &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CRGB off(0,0,0)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main things to change to your needs is in the first few lines,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Consider not only the number stair-step but also one more which is even to the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is a pain to make so many long connectors, 12 sensors…&lt;/li&gt;

But let’s spice it up a bit by making them user aware. Okay, let’s put a motion sensor nearby and this activated the lights when you are in the vicinity. Well… no it can be even cooler, how about making it stair-step-aware?! stair-step-awareness Wouldn’t it be cool if the stairs would light up exactly on your current step? I think it would be and that is exactly the goal of today. Towards this, I designed a custom system that adds some flair to your stairs! It consists of three main components, Addressable RGB led-strip Step presence detection Controller Addressable RGB led-strip To look cool I didn’t opt for just a white led-strip but an RGB one that is individually addressable, because we want to do cool things with it… Such as stair-step awareness (SSA). Our stairs have 12 steps each of approximate length of 1 meter. This means I need 12 meters of LED strip, luckily due to mass fabrication these can be and are quite cheap, but what should one choose? It depends on a few factors but I mainly concentrated on, Voltage drop on an RGB led-strip and my choice The main factor to consider here is that at 12 meters in length the voltage drop can be quite significant, hence choosing LED chips that work with a higher operation voltage are more convenient to use. Why is this? Consider for similar LED efficiency (the same amount of energy is required to give a certain amount of light), the power is constant then for LED with higher operation voltage less current is required. Then by Ohm’s law \(V_{drop} = I^2R\) is lower for LEDs with higher operating voltage. This means the LED strip will not become dim over its length. Additionally, one could opt to connect the power source at regular intervals on the total LED strip, however this requires additional wire and floor planning. Therefore, it is better to choose a more suitable LED strip. The most common options are, 5 V and 12 V. Since 5 V is the lowest option here, 12 V is preferred because of the lower voltage drop. This made my choice to fall on the WS2811 the higher voltage brother of the WS2812B which is common in many projects. Brightness, trueness of color and power consumption, etc. In the end there are many more factors to consider. Some LED strips are better in some of the factors but in the end the WS2811 was the cheapest per meter and suited my needs. Some alternatives are, SK6812 and APA102. Step presence detection To achieve the SSA, we need to somehow know when someone is on a step. Let’s consider some mechanics and imagine you are standing on a stair-step. When you step on a step, your foot is on the step. This induces pressure but also your foot is physically there. I came up with the two following mechanisms to detect the presence on a certain step. Light-blocking Pressure Light-blocking When your foot is on the step it is physically there. This means if there is a light sensor it would be blocked off by your foot. This could be sideways or in the step itself as depicted here. These methods have a few cons, for sideways you would require an additional light source. For in you can use your natural lighting such as diffuse light, however, this would not work very well at night. Also, the intensity can vary over the day so you would need some automatic calibration to distinguish between low light or ‘is being stepped on’ conditions. Pressure Since the light-blocking method is possible. I deemed it too complex to do, so I thought of an alternative. Where I use pressure sensors and with this in my I went ahead and found two types of pressure sensors Strain-gauge Thin-film pressure sensor The strain gauge required me to glue them on the backside of the stairs. In that way, it can bend together with the wood and hence measure presence. This required a lot of glue and modifications so I did not prefer this. Whereas thin films can be placed very unobtrusively onto the stair-step. Since we were planning to use stair nosings profiles, they could be perfectly hidden underneath them. These sensors have huge resistance and once it compresses the resistance decreases. So the controller needs to read the resistance in some smart way to detect presence. More on that below… Controller In this project I needed two main functionalities to be achieved by this controller. 1) The controller knows which step I am standing on, SSA 2) Correct color is sent to the RGB led-strip One of the most known microcontrollers is the Arduino since it is so popular a lot of libraries are created for it and this makes my life a lot easier. Less time spent on re-inventing the wheel is more time to do cool projects. But, not only software is needed but also hardware since we are using real physical sensors. Thin-film pressure sensor readout The circuitry that is used is very simple, there are two states. Either you are on the step or you are not on the step. These two states can be distinguished by looking at the resistance of the sensor, this means we need to distinguish between high and low resistance states. As mentioned before the resistance decreases if it is compressed hence it makes sense to choose everything below a certain threshold, that is the on the step state and everything above is not on the step state. Comparator to sense the state To achieve state readout we can use a comparator, which can be explained with the following image, It basically does what I explained before, if you use a 5 V supply it makes sense to set \(V_{REF} = 2.5V\) and thus choose the resistors equally. However, since I have 12 steps I have to do this 12x? Time multiplexing is less hardware Since OPAMPs are not very cheap ~ €1,- a piece and the number of control pins on the Arduino is limited I chose to do time multiplexing. In time-multiplexing I make use of the fact that I don’t need to constantly know whether someone is on the step, but only once in a while. The Arduino’s clock frequency is 32 MHz so I could read out my stairs at MHz speeds which means million times per second. But I don’t need to know it that often hence I could easily divide this by 12 and read all 12 steps with time multiplexing. Electronics schema for LED controller PCB To achieve all of the hardware functionalities I created a small PCB that neatly packs everything together, with its schema below A few things to note from left to right and up to down. I used a DC-DC converter so I could use a single supply for LED and my controller PCB. Some external connector to connect to the LED strip and also control a relay if needed Time multiplexing where W0-W11 are the pressure sensors and IC1 is the multiplexing chip Biasing for the comparator circuit achieved with OPAMP R4 series resistor to prevent short circuits of the weight sensor R1 is a pulldown resistor The Arduino, pro mini because it is cheap --- **NOTE** The labels with same name means they are connected together --- Arduino code for controller To make everything work together of course code is needed. So the software has these functionalities, when the presence is detected it turns all the lights on to CRGB on(122,122,122). The step above your current step will be set to CRGB stepColordown(255,0,0) and the step below your current step will be CRGB stepColorup(0,255,0). After it turns on and the presence is gone, it will fade to CRGB bgColor( 122, 122, 122) and after 15 seconds it will fade to no light CRGB off(0,0,0).

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-recent-design-of-a-zigbee-stick&quot;&gt;A recent design of a ZigBee stick&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shiko.nl/programming/espeasy-restart/&quot;&gt;As mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, I had issues with my old ZigBee stick. Also due to low inventory, because of shortages of the new ZigBee TI CC2652  USB sticks, I took upon myself to design my own. It was a nice pet project because I also wanted to learn Altium designer, while before this I always worked with autodesk EAGLE. The design of this stick is something I also want to share but will be for later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;okay-i-have-one-what-now&quot;&gt;Okay I have one, what now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the ShiBee stick comes ready with the firmware already flashed on there. Depending on your needs you might want to flash a newer version or the router firmware. Due to the great support of the community &lt;a href=&quot;https://slae.sh/projects/cc2652/#flashing&quot;&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://electrolama.com/radio-docs/#step-3-flash-the-firmware-on-your-stick&quot;&gt;guides&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/egony/cc2652p_E72-2G4M20S1E/wiki/Flashing-EN&quot;&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://zig-star.com/radio-docs/flash-cc-bsl/&quot;&gt;floating&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://circuitsetup.us/product/usb-zigbee-stick-z-stack-coordinator/&quot;&gt;around&lt;/a&gt;. However, for good practice that only I can promise a how-to guide can stay available, I will repeat the steps here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flashing-of-the-shibee-stick&quot;&gt;Flashing of the ShiBee stick&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/downloads/&quot;&gt;python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open your python terminal&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python --version&lt;/code&gt; check whether it displays &amp;gt;=3.4&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pip install pyserial intelhex&lt;/code&gt; dependencies&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download the firmware (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/master/coordinator/Z-Stack_3.x.0/bin&quot;&gt;coordinator&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/master/router/Z-Stack_3.x.0/bin&quot;&gt;router&lt;/a&gt;) with “CC1352”, please select the “other” version as it will make sure the LEDs work. The filename is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FIRMWARE&lt;/code&gt;. The script that will be used in python can be downloaded from &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeload.github.com/JelmerT/cc2538-bsl/zip/master&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open device manager if on windows or use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lsusb&lt;/code&gt; and find what name = &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PORT&lt;/code&gt;  your computer gave your CH340 usb device. &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shikon/cloudimg/master/typora/image-20220109181945934.png&quot; alt=&quot;image-20220109181945934&quot; style=&quot;zoom:50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python cc2538-bsl.py -p PORT -evw FIRMWARE&lt;/code&gt; In my case &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PORT&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;COM5&lt;/code&gt; and my file is renamed to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flash_me_router.zip&lt;/code&gt;. Hence it can look something like this: &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shikon/cloudimg/master/typora/image-20220109190614818.png&quot; alt=&quot;image-20220109190614818&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have flashed your device, congratz!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;erasing-of-the-shibee-stick&quot;&gt;Erasing of the ShiBee stick&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just want an empty stick in that case just run.
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python cc2538-bsl.py -p PORT -e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clearing-nvram-of-the-shibee-stick&quot;&gt;Clearing NVRAM of the ShiBee stick&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the certain procedures in the script some garbage might prevent you from restoring from the coordinator’s memory (NVRAM). To prevent this you can use the script available from your zigbee2mqtt installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Locate in the zigbee2mqtt folder under &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.../scripts&lt;/code&gt; , which typically is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/opt/zigbee2mqtt/scripts &lt;/code&gt;  the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;zStackEraseAllNvMem.js&lt;/code&gt; script.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node zStackEraseAllNvMem.js /dev/ttyUSB0&lt;/code&gt; Will clear the NVRAM, note that ttUSB0 is typically the name it gets in Linux OS’s such as Raspbian for raspberry pi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;tearing-down-the-ebyte-e72-2g4m20s1e&quot;&gt;Tearing down the EBYTE E72 2G4M20S1E&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main ‘sub’-component of the board is EBYTE module which houses all the necessary components for the CC2652 chip. However it is covered with a metal shield as you can see. &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shikon/cloudimg/master/typora/IMG_20220109_141322.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_20220109_141322&quot; style=&quot;zoom: 25%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is done to prevent the antenna’s electromagnetic waves from interfering with the components on the EBYTE module. To open it up I took my hot air gun and removed it with a bit of heat. Then we are shown with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shikon/cloudimg/master/typora/IMG_20220109_142224.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_20220109_142224&quot; style=&quot;zoom: 50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say the PCB looks pretty good and the soldering also. I would like to reverse-engineer some small sub-circuits just for curiosity, however I unfortunately do not have a microscope. So I will let this rest. Overall I am quite positive over the module’s quality what I can see by eye. Also the virtual render they had on their website is actually pretty close how it looks in real, which is a + for me as I dislike marketing trickery. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebyte.com/en/product-view-news.html?id=1002&quot;&gt;below (taken from)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
