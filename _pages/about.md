Fascinated by physics as well as modern devices I currently engineer for a company which is making many lives easier and more fulfilling. In my free time I like to be active but it is hard to balance with my passion for technology. Understanding my DIY projects from all abstraction levels, from device to system is my joy.

## Goal

Is to (b)log my random projects, so I can share but also  improve retention of the skills I learn. I have found the internet to be a great resource and would love to contribute to it. I am here to share my thought processes and take you with me, on my journey.

## Random facts
