Fascinated by physics as well as modern devices, I started a BSc. degree in Applied Physics and afterwards also Electrical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Currently, I am trying to close the gap between circuit design and novel semiconductors during my joint MSc. degree in the same fields.

## Goal

Is to (b)log my random projects, so I can share but also  improve retention of the skills I learn. I have found the internet to be a great resource and would also like to contribute to it I want to share my thought processes and take you with me, on my journey.

## Random facts 

- Intern at the moment
- Likes 3D printing, Arduino,  IoT, smarthome, traveling, hardware and embedded systems
- Values self-development
