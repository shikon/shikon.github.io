<p>Fascinated by physics as well as modern devices, I started a BSc. degree in Applied Physics and afterwards also Electrical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Currently, I am trying to close the gap between circuit design and novel semiconductors during my joint MSc. degree in the same fields.</p>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>

<p>Is to (b)log my random projects, so I can share but also  improve retention of the skills I learn. I have found the internet to be a great resource and would also like to contribute to it I want to share my thought processes and take you with me, on my journey.</p>
