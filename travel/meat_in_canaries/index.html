I couldn’t help but marvel at the economic intricacies that made this possible, particularly the timely delivery of perishable goods like Argentine beef via ships. It’s a phenomenon made feasible by the affordability of oil, a topic I delved into in a previous post.  The popularity of imported beef in Tenerife and even in Madeira (my next destination) underscored the resilience of global food export patterns.  A Global Tapestry of Flavors As I reflect on the succulent bites savored in Tenerife, the unexpected connection between local tastes and global influences has left me both satisfied and intrigued.  The intricate dance between economics, accessibility, and culinary preferences paints a captivating picture of how our world has evolved into a global tapestry of flavors. From the vibrant streets of Tenerife to the enchanting landscapes of Madeira, the journey through diverse palates has opened my eyes to the rich interplay between local traditions and the global food stage. As I linger over the last memories of the steak tartare, my palate tingling with the lingering taste, I find myself unable to resist the allure of the unknown.  The culinary surprises that await in the next corner of my travels are a tantalizing prospect, promising more revelations about globalization, food and culture.">
