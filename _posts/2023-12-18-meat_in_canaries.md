# Why I escape the cold
Ever since I tossed my graduation cap into the air, Iâ€™ve made a habit of escaping the chilly winters of The Netherlands. 
The Canary Islands swiftly became my haven, it is a readily accessible retreat offering affordable, visa-free flights. 
On my latest expedition, I embarked on a culinary adventure in Tenerife, where I sought to explore the unexpected interplay of tastes, cultures, and culinary traditions. 
Join me as I delve into the vibrant streets of Tenerife and the enchanting landscapes of Madeira.

# No cow, no beef
Upon landing, my mate and I were on a mission: find the perfect steak tartare restaurant. 
Rumor had it that somewhere on Tenerife a great steak tartare is served.
After some searching, we discovered [it](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X6H1d7h7JT25ngkp6).
Obviously the entre was already set in stone, the steak tartare. 
Now we were faced with the delightful dilemma of choosing our mains.
Opting for a succulent rib eye, I eagerly cut into the medium-rare beef and was met with a strangely familiar taste, one that transported me back to Western Europe.

# Canarian beef or Argentinan beef
Curiosity piqued and I decided to inquire about the origin of the beef. 
The restaurant staff, friendly and accommodating, confirmed my suspicions with a casual, "Anywhere between the UK and Poland. Depends on the season, really." 
This unexpected revelation triggered reflections on a recent post I penned about the intricate [interplay of culture and food](https://shiko.nl/travel/why_travel/), a topic I explore more thoroughly [link to previous post on food].

Unlike my previous experience with Canarian beef in Gran Canaria, this time the meat had a familiar taste. 
The local cows, it seemed, had given way to imports.
This observation actually became a recurring theme throughout my holiday, each bite of beef was a reminder of the interconnectedness of global food trade.

I couldn't help but marvel at the economic intricacies that made this possible, particularly the timely delivery of perishable goods like Argentine beef via ships. It's a phenomenon made feasible by the affordability of oil, a topic I delved into in a [previous post](https://shiko.nl/growth/pricing_of_oil/). 
The popularity of imported beef in Tenerife and even in Madeira (my next destination) underscored the resilience of global food export patterns.

# A Global Tapestry of Flavors
As I reflect on the succulent bites savored in Tenerife, the unexpected connection between local tastes and global influences has left me both satisfied and intrigued. 
The intricate dance between economics, accessibility, and culinary preferences paints a captivating picture of how our world has evolved into a global tapestry of flavors.
From the vibrant streets of Tenerife to the enchanting landscapes of Madeira, the journey through diverse palates has opened my eyes to the rich interplay between local traditions and the global food stage.
As I linger over the last memories of the steak tartare, my palate tingling with the lingering taste, I find myself unable to resist the allure of the unknown. 
The culinary surprises that await in the next corner of my travels are a tantalizing prospect, promising more revelations about globalization, food and culture.
