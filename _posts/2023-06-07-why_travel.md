# Why I Travel and the Significance of Food
Traveling is a true passion of mine, just like cooking. It opens up a world of new experiences and allows me to delve into different cultures, especially through their food. While traveling, I often encounter tastes and culinary practices that differ from what I'm accustomed to. It's natural for humans to gravitate towards what they are familiar with, which means it's not unusual to have preferences or dislikes when it comes to food from other cultures. Exploring these culinary differences is what truly captivates me, and I find it fascinating to understand the reasons behind the popularity and preferences of various regional dishes.
# The Influence of History on Food
Throughout my travels, I have made some simple yet intriguing observations that highlight the influence of history on the types of food enjoyed in different regions. Here are a few examples:
## Coastal Cities and Fresh Fish
Historically, coastal cities have had a strong affinity for fish. In the past, fish could only be enjoyed when it was freshly caught, which was feasible only in locations near the sea or other bodies of water. Nowadays, with efficient trade routes and advanced preservation techniques like ice, any type of fish can be transported across the globe. However, the preference for fish remains rooted in the historical context of coastal cities.
## The Culinary Impact of Poverty
Poverty often shapes culinary traditions as well. For instance, in Madrid, which was relatively poor in the past, it was challenging to afford premium cuts of meat. This led to the consumption of offal parts such as beef tripe, giving rise to dishes like "Callos" in Spanish cuisine. Similarly, South Korea, having experienced rapid modernization within the last century, still values offal parts due to their historical significance.
## Religious Influence on Food Choices
Religious rules and practices have also played a significant role in shaping food preferences. During a recent visit to Romania, a friend and I noticed that beef was relatively expensive compared to pork. After inquiring, we discovered that Romania's historical association with the Ottoman Empire led to high taxes on beef due to Islamic dietary restrictions. Consequently, beef imports became more common, resulting in fewer local cattle farmers.
## The Sober Food Culture of the Netherlands
In the Netherlands, there is a unique perspective on food known as "nuchter." This concept can be described as having an objective and emotionless view, prioritizing efficiency over taste. The Dutch food culture, often characterized by the "AGV" or "PVM" dinner (Potatoes, Veggies, and Meat), is a result of historical circumstances, including times of scarcity such as the Dutch Famine during World War II. Quantity has often taken precedence over quality in this context.
## The Influence of Culture
Culture, in its essence, is a culmination of historical events and factors that shape specific traits, including food preferences[^1]. The type of food enjoyed in a particular country is just one aspect of its broader cultural identity. Each country is unique due to a combination of factors such as geography, historical events, and societal customs. The examples I shared merely scratch the surface of the intricate connections between history, culture, and food. I encourage you, as the reader, to embark on your own travel adventures and explore these fascinating relationships firsthand.

In conclusion, my love for traveling stems from the desire to explore diverse cultures, with food being a significant element of that exploration. Through my experiences, I have come to appreciate the influence of history, poverty, religion,
